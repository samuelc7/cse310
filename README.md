# Overview

This is a sample project for me to make sure that I have correct enviornments set up for future projects. It's also to make sure that my git and github are set up correctly. 

This program will display "hello world" on the terminal. 

The purpose of this program is to make sure that all of my enviornments are set up correctly and to say hi to the world.
